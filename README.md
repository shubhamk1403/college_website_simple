# college_website_simple
This a simple website created with HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap. The backend has been designed in Java.

# OVERVIEW

I created this website couple of months ago when I was learning CSS. This website is a combination of static as well as dynamic pages.
I used Netbeans IDE for the Java part of this project. Most of the css content used here is learnt on W3Schools so there can be some similarity.

This site is under construction and I'm trying to design the whole website using Java Spring Framework so this project will see a lot of commits in the coming days.

Also, the first two pages were designed by Mobirise web developement tool as I was trying to learn how jQuery and Bootstrap are used efficiently.
